- `number`: number of the station. This is NOT an id, thus it is unique only inside a contract.
- `contract_name`: name of the contract of the station
- `name`: name of the station
- `address`: address of the station. As it is raw data, sometimes it will be more of a comment than an address.
- `position`: position of the station in WGS84 format
- `banking`: indicates whether this station has a payment terminal
- `bonus`: indicates whether this is a bonus station
